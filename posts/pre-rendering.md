title: 'How ElevenLabs Turned Localization From Cost-Center to AI Growth Engine'
date: '2020-01-01'

## TL;DR
ElevenLabs replaced third-party translation vendors with an internal AI agent in under a week, slicing per-word costs ~70 % and shrinking “idea -> multi-language release” from weeks to hours. Below is the playbook you can reuse tomorrow.


## Long read

### 1 · Why This Matters

Localization is the perfect storm of high spend + low complexity + clear KPIs. Yet most enterprises still outsource it. ElevenLabs asked a simpler question:

```
Could three engineers and a weekend beat a seven-figure vendor contract?
```

Answer: yes - provided you follow a ruthlessly narrow scope and ship something ugly first.



2 · The Architecture (≈200 LoC)

| Layer | What They Used | Why It's Boring-Good |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|
| Agent | GPT-4o via API + Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on brand glossary | Zero infra to maintain; fast to prototype |
| Vector Store | Weaviate | Off-the-shelf semantic search; SaaS pricing |
| Backend | FastAPI + Celery queue | Async batch + realtime callbacks |
| Frontend | Next.js + Tailwind | CRUD only—no design awards needed |
| Observability | Datadog logs + BigQuery cost table | Tie latency & spend to each file |

Total new code: ~200 logical lines. That’s why it launched on Day 5.

3 · Patterns You Should Shamelessly Copy

🎯 Pattern #1 — Hunt High-Cost / Low-Novelty Jobs
	•	Translation agencies charged ElevenLabs six figures annually.
	•	Accuracy is binary (match glossary or fix).
	•	Failure roll-back = “send file to old vendor.”
Try this filter across your P&L—something equally boring will pop.

🛠 Pattern #2 — Internal First, External Never

Serving only their own marketing team meant:
	•	Zero multi-tenant auth headaches
	•	One brand voice to protect, not 50
	•	Instant Slack feedback loop

👥 Pattern #3 — 90 % Agent, 10 % Human

Humans still:
	1.	Review edge-case paragraphs.
	2.	Feed corrections back into RAG store.
	3.	Own “voice risk” in critical releases.
Net: ~10 % of old workload, but higher QA.

4 · Why This Beats PowerPoint “AI Transformations”

Classic Enterprise Program	ElevenLabs Way
6-month strategy deck	6-day spike
$2 M consultancy fee	three salaries
“End-to-end digital overhaul”	one workflow
Org-wide change-management	reversible toggle

Result? While competitors debate frameworks, ElevenLabs ships v3.

5 · Observable Impact
	•	Per-word cost ↓ ~70 % (agent runtime ≈ $0.015/min at scale)  ￼
	•	Time-to-publish ↓ > 80 % (hours vs. weeks)
	•	Language coverage ↑ 31 langs by default, no new headcount  ￼
	•	Learning loop every push enriches glossary → model improves → humans review less.

6 · Your 6-Point Applied-AI Checklist
	1.	One-Sentence Problem — “We burn $X translating Y.”
	2.	Quantifiable Win — track cost/word or cycle time.
	3.	Weekend MVP — if > 2 weeks, cut scope again.
	4.	Direct Users — same Slack channel as build team.
	5.	Cheap Reversal — keep fallback vendor on retainer.
	6.	Metrics or It Didn’t Happen — wire logs to cost dashboards first, UX later.

7 · Action for Friday
	•	Identify your “localization equivalent.”
	•	Block 48 hrs sprint.
	•	Glue OpenAI API to a minimal UI.
	•	Ship ugly; instrument everything.
	•	Decide Monday if to scrap or double-down.

Because in applied AI the durable moat isn’t the model—it’s the speed-of-iteration muscle your team builds while everyone else is still reviewing policy decks.
