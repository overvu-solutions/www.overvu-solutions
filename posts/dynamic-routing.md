Dynamic routing is a powerful feature in Next.js that allows you to create pages with dynamic URLs. This is particularly useful for blogs, e-commerce sites, and any application where you need to generate pages based on dynamic data.

## Creating Dynamic Routes

To create a dynamic route, you need to add brackets to a page name. For example:

- `pages/posts/[id].js` - matches `/posts/1`, `/posts/abc`, etc.
- `pages/posts/[...slug].js` - matches `/posts/a`, `/posts/a/b`, `/posts/a/b/c`, etc.

## Using getStaticPaths

When using Static Generation with dynamic routes, you need to define a list of paths that should be pre-rendered to HTML at build time.

```javascript
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // Return a list of possible values for id
  return {
    paths: [
      { params: { id: '1' } },
      { params: { id: '2' } }
    ],
    fallback: false
  }
}
```

## Using getStaticProps

You can then use `getStaticProps` to fetch the data needed to render the page with the given `id`.

```javascript
export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  // Fetch necessary data for the blog post using params.id
  const postData = await getPostData(params.id)
  
  return {
    props: {
      postData
    }
  }
}
```

This combination allows you to build fast, SEO-friendly pages that are generated at build time.
