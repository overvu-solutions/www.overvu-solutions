## **1 - Why?**

I’ve sat through enough “AI transformation” meetings to know the ending:
Big Vision -> Impressive Slides -> “Let’s form a task force” -> Death by committee.

Here’s what pisses me off:  everyone’s debating `strategy` some teams are just shipping.

One of them? ElevenLabs.

Let me show you what execution looks like.

## **2 - TL;DR**

ElevenLabs killed the localization agency model by building a lean internal AI pipeline: ASR → LLM → TTS → Human QA.
Result: 90% cost reduction, hours instead of weeks to launch, and the ability to ship campaigns in 30+ languages simultaneously.

## **3 - What Changed?**

ElevenLabs was doing what everyone does:

- $50k localization platform
- Agencies for every market ($100k+/year)
- Delays, back-and-forth, endless approvals

Then someone did the obvious: Proofread the copy with GPT. It crushed the agency’s work.

That broke the loop.

**Before AI:**

- Localization = days to weeks
- Cost = $150k+ per campaign
- Brand voice = fragile across markets

**After AI:**

- Localization = done in hours
- Cost = -90%
- Quality = 90% AI, 10% human mod (on the edges)

💡 **Critical unlock:**

It wasn’t just cost savings.

They could **launch globally, simultaneously**—a growth advantage worth way more.

That’s what I call Applied AI. No decks required.


## 4 Patterns You Should Shamelessly Copy

### 4.1. Pattern #1 — Hunt for “High Cost, Low Novelty”

Jobs where:

- You pay six figures.
- The work is boring and repetitive.
- Failure is reversible (“just send it back to the old vendor”).

🔍 Check your P&L.

You’ll find something equally dumb you’re overpaying for.



### 4.1. Pattern #2 — Internal First, External Never

They shipped for *one* team: marketing.

That meant:

- No multi-tenant security headaches
- One brand voice to tune
- Instant Slack feedback loop

Don’t launch platforms. Solve your problem first.

### 4.1. Pattern #3 — 90% Agent, 10% Human

Forget the “autonomous AI” hype.

Here’s what works:

1. AI translates 90% of it
2. Human reviews edge cases
3. Feedback gets fed back into the RAG store

**Net:**

- ⏱ 10% of the old workload
- ✅ Higher quality


## 5 The 6-Point Applied-AI Checklist

1. **One-Sentence Problem**
“We burn $X translating Y.”
2. **Quantifiable Win**
Track cost-per-word or time-to-publish.
3. **Weekend MVP**
If it takes > 2 weeks to test, cut the scope again.
4. **Tight Feedback Loop**
Build a team that shares a Slack with users.
5. **Cheap Reversal Plan**
Keep fallback vendor on standby—no risk.
6. **Metrics First**
Hook logs into cost dashboards *before* UX polish.
